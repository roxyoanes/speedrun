      Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors.
      In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the
      warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing,
      and kayaking.
    </p>
    <p className="interests__description">
      When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies
      and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of
      my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end
      web development world.
